## Aspirations

Data Science Professional with 2 years of experience learning and implementing machine learning techniques, visualizations, data cleaning and manipulation in several projects. My greatest strength is lifelong learning, which provides the ability to adapt to different situations.

I'm Dylan Baldessari, I live in Valley Stream, New York, and am a recent graduate of Long Island University Post with a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration and a concentration in Finance. I am currently attending Northeastern University for a Master's degree in Analytics.

I have various job experiences from the small to corporate level. During quarantine, I messaged my old professors at LIU Post and asked for assistance in getting started with learning data analytics. I then devoted time to learning coding languages like Python, R, and SQL through online courses and projects. I have used these skills in many forms of my life from school to investing. During my tenure at the local business, I realized the opportunity data analytics presents for small businesses. The pandemic has harshly affected these small businesses and I would like to in the future be able to help small businesses thrive with the power of analytics. Though my master's program and projects I have gathered the tools to help and allow me to have a job I love to do every day. My hobbies are cooking for my family, watching sports such as soccer and formula one, and compete in formula one simulated driving compeitions.
